# Question 1

For lab credit, submit at least one table or figure from (some of?) the data that you plan to use for the final\
project. Describe the data in the figure or the values in the table.\

Choosing your research question and data is a very important step. Try to choose something that you care\
about and that you can use to practice and further develop your data science skills.\

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

```

```{r}

gym_members_data <- read_csv("gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv")

maga_gym_data <- read_csv("megaGymDataset.csv")


```

```{r}

type_maga_counts <- maga_gym_data %>%
  count(Type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# View the results
type_counts


type_gym_counts <- gym_members_data %>%
  count(Workout_Type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# View the results
type_gym_counts

```
